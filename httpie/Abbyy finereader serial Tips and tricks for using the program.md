If you have already installed Abbyy Finereader on your PC, you can also find the serial number by opening the program and going to menu Help -> About -> License Info. There you will see your serial number as well as your Support ID[^1^]. The Support ID is a unique code that identifies your installation of Abbyy Finereader and can be used to restore your serial number in case you lose it.
