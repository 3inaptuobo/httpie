Chemical engineering is a branch of engineering that applies the principles of chemistry, physics, mathematics, and biology to design and operate processes that convert raw materials into useful products and energy. Chemical engineers also deal with environmental issues, such as pollution control, waste management, and renewable energy sources.
 
One of the fundamental skills of chemical engineering is the ability to perform calculations that involve material and energy balances, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, mass transfer, reaction kinetics, and process control. These calculations require a systematic approach and a clear understanding of the concepts and assumptions involved.

A classic textbook that covers the basic principles and calculations in chemical engineering is *Basic Principles and Calculations in Chemical Engineering* by David M. Himmelblau and James B. Riggs[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. This book, which is now in its eighth edition, has been widely used by students, instructors, and practitioners for over 50 years. It provides a comprehensive introduction to the core topics of chemical engineering, as well as applications that reflect the current trends and challenges in the field.
 
The book is organized into modular chapters that can be adapted to different courses and levels of difficulty. Each chapter begins with an overview of the objectives and key concepts, followed by examples and solved problems that illustrate the methods and techniques. The chapters also include self-assessment questions, thought/discussion problems, homework problems, student projects, tables, charts, glossaries, and reference appendices. The book covers topics such as:
